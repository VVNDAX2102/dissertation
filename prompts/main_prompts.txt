--------------------------- INTRODUCTION ---------------------------------

I am writing a dissertation thesis on the topic of - how technical indicators
perform on Indian, UK, and US publically traded funds. The technical indicators 
that I am choosing right now are Bollinger bands, RSI, MACD, and Ichimoku Clouds. 
For each country I have taken one fund representing each sector: consumer goods,
energy, finance and banking, healthcare, and technology. The thing that I am 
interested to check is does one indicator performs better in predicting market 
movements than others in a different country across markets. 

I want your help in writing the introduction to this thesis topic in 1000 words. 
I want you to include subject, significance, research questions, any hypotheses 
you feel relevant and worth checking, and a small note on how the thesis report
proceeds. For your context, I have literature review, experiment design and data overview,
methodology, analysis and interpretation, conclusion and then future work coming up
next in sequence. Do not give me a dry start. The opening line should be a hook. 
Do not put anything that should be a part of literature review. For example: 
Gaps in the research, other relevant works, etc. Keep everything of this 
kind for the next section. Do not give me any closing notes. 

I want you to write this in a natural human language. Use simple language — short, plain sentences.
Avoid AI giveaway phrases like “dive into,” “unleash,” or “game-changing.”
Be direct and concise — cut extra words.
Maintain a natural tone — write like people actually talk. It’s fine to start with “and” or “but.”
Skip marketing language — no hype, no exaggeration.
Keep it honest — don’t fake friendliness or overpromise.
Simplify grammar — casual grammar is okay if it feels more human.
Cut the fluff — skip extra adjectives or filler words.
Focus on clarity — make it easy to understand.
Avoid long hyphens and em dashes, colons and bullet points wherever you can. 

Give me output in latex code without boilerplate code. I want response in a codeblock. 
Eg. ```latex response```. Also, utilize mathematical syntax for the hypotheses for H_0, H_1, etc. 
Write in detail about the hypothesis in the english language very clearly, and then the mathematical
form of it. Do this for each hypotheses.

------------------------ LITERATURE REVIEW --------------------------------------

I am writing a dissertation thesis on the topic of - how technical indicators
perform on Indian, UK, and US publically traded funds. The technical indicators 
that I am choosing right now are Bollinger bands, RSI, MACD, and Ichimoku Clouds. 
For each country I have taken one fund representing each sector: consumer goods,
energy, finance and banking, healthcare, and technology. The thing that I am 
interested to check is does one indicator performs better in predicting market 
movements than others in a different country across markets. 

I want your help in writing the literature review to this thesis topic in 4000 words.
Things I expect in this section are Critical review of relevant literature; identifying 
gaps or questions in the literature; and development of conceptual framework. 
I want you to develop the argument coherently. The flow of ideas should feel in natural
progression. Follow the following guidelines while writing this section. 

1. Add citations using \cite{} to the previous work. And for all citations that you add, give me the references to add in a .bib file separately. I will copy paste those contents and put in the references.bib file. 
2. You can refer to the numbers and important points and results from those references. 
3. Assume user doesn't know much about technical indicators or any trading concept, you will have to build it. 

Refer to the following writing style guide. 

1. Use simple language — short, plain sentences.
2. Avoid AI giveaway phrases like “dive into,” “unleash,” or “game-changing.”
3. Be direct and concise — cut extra words.
4. Maintain a natural tone — write like people actually talk. It’s fine to start with “and” or “but.”
5. Skip marketing language — no hype, no exaggeration.

7. Simplify grammar — casual grammar is okay if it feels more human.
8. Cut the fluff — skip extra adjectives or filler words.
9. Focus on clarity — make it easy to understand.
10. Avoid long hyphens and em dashes, colons and bullet points wherever you can. 

I have written the following as my introduction to this thesis as follows. Try to reduce the repetition of what we say. 

Give me output in latex code without boilerplate code. I want response in a codeblock. 
Eg. ```latex response```.
