--------------------------- INTRODUCTION ---------------------------------

I am writing a dissertation thesis on the topic of - how technical indicators
perform on Indian, UK, and US publically traded funds. The technical indicators 
that I am choosing right now are Bollinger bands, RSI, MACD, and Ichimoku Clouds. 
For each country I have taken one fund representing each sector: consumer goods,
energy, finance and banking, healthcare, and technology. The thing that I am 
interested to check is does one indicator performs better in predicting market 
movements than others in a different country across markets. 

I want your help in writing the introduction to this thesis topic in 1000 words. 
I want you to include subject, significance, research questions, any hypotheses 
you feel relevant and worth checking, and a small note on how the thesis report
proceeds. For your context, I have literature review, experiment design and data overview,
methodology, analysis and interpretation, conclusion and then future work coming up
next in sequence. 

I want you to write this in a natural human language. Use simple language — short, plain sentences.
Avoid AI giveaway phrases like “dive into,” “unleash,” or “game-changing.”
Be direct and concise — cut extra words.
Maintain a natural tone — write like people actually talk. It’s fine to start with “and” or “but.”
Skip marketing language — no hype, no exaggeration.
Keep it honest — don’t fake friendliness or overpromise.
Simplify grammar — casual grammar is okay if it feels more human.
Cut the fluff — skip extra adjectives or filler words.
Focus on clarity — make it easy to understand.
